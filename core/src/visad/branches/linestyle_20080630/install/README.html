<h2>To download VisAD-in-a-Box:</h2>
<a href="ftp://ftp.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/visad-2.0/visad-in-a-box.tar.gz">VisAD-in-a-Box</a><br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> This currently contains only the Solaris JDK.
<h2>To install VisAD-in-a-Box:</h2>
<ol>
 <li>If you've received an <tt>visad-in-a-box.tar</tt> file,
     run <tt>tar xvf visad-in-a-box.tar</tt>
 <li>If you've received an <tt>visad-in-a-box.tar.gz</tt> file,
     run <tt>gzcat -c visad-in-a-box.tar | tar xvf -</tt>
 <li>Move into the extracted <tt>visad-in-a-box</tt> distribution
     directory and run <tt>install_visad</tt>
 <li>Answer the few installation questions,
     then wait for everything to finish installing.
 <li>You can remove the <tt>visad-in-a-box</tt> distribution
     directory after the installation is complete.
</ol>

<b>Note:</b> The <tt>cpush</tt> utility must be available in order
             to install on all nodes in a cluster.
<br>
<h2>To keep your visad.jar file up to date:</h2>
Simply run <tt>java visad.install.UpdateJar <i>dir</i></tt>
where <i>dir</i> is the directory in which you've installed
your visad.jar file.<br>
<br>
This will only update the local <tt>visad.jar</tt> file if it is older
than the distributed <tt>visad.jar</tt> file.

<h2>To create a new VisAD-in-a-Box distribution:</h2>

<ol>
 <li>Create a distribution directory (in this example, the distribution
     directory will be named <tt>visad-in-a-box</tt>.)
 <li>Copy visad/install/install_visad to the <tt>visad-in-a-box</tt>
     directory
 <li>Copy a visad.jar file to the <tt>visad-in-a-box</tt> directory.
 <ul>
  <li>If you have a VisAD source distribution,
      you can run <tt>make compile</tt> (or <tt>make recompile</tt>)
      to compile all the VisAD sources, then run
      <tt>make classes</tt> to create visad.jar in the
      directory about the Makefile.
 </ul>
 <li>If you want to include Java executables, you can
     do either of the following:
  <ul>
   <li>Copy a JDK directory tree into the <tt>visad-in-a-box</tt>
       directory and name it jdk-<i>OS</i>-<i>MACH</i>
       where <i>OS</i> is whatever is printed by <tt>uname -s</tt>
       and <i>MACH</i> is whatever is printed by <tt>uname -p</tt>.
   <br>
       If you do this, the included <tt>java</tt> executable
       will be used to run the installer on machines which
       match this machine's <i>OS</i> and <i>MACH</i>.
   <li>Package up a JDK directory tree in a jar file
       named jdk-<i>OS</i>-<i>MACH</i>.jar (where <i>OS</i> and <i>MACH</i>
       are as in the item above.)
  </ul>
 <li>In the directory above the <tt>visad-in-a-box</tt> directory,
     package everything up with
     <tt>tar cvf visad-in-a-box.tar visad-in-a-box</tt>
     (or whatever you've named your distribution directory.)
</ol>
